%h3 Welcome to C-Game!

%p
  C-Game is a gathering of like-minded friends and their friends.
  %li A host chooses a menu of connection-related activities.
  %li People get invited; size of the group limited only by the venue
  %li There are opening and closing circles
  %li In between, people split into groups and choose from the activity menu
  %li Each time slot is by default 45 minutes, but could be very flexible too

%p
  C-Game is...
  %ul
    %li Doing my favorite things with my favorite people
    %li A place where we build our own adventures, together
    %li A game first and foremost... though support, etc. may happen
    %li An invitation to play full-out while respecting yourself
    %li Built through connection & group wisdom

%p
  What happens...
  %ul
  %li We start with a T-group and very brief intro
  %li We discuss a couple of agreements (first time this week)
  %li We then break up into small groups...
  %li ...each formed around a specific activity they order off the menu
  %li And do this for two or three roughly 45-minute rounds.

C-Games are invite-only. If you want to bring a friend, please tell a host why they'd be a great fit and request that the host invite them.

Happy Gaming!
