VALUES = {
  # 'C for Connection' => 'The desire to connect is fundamental to C-Game. We prefer activities that connect us, rather than inform, heal or stimulate us. We co-host and co-create, because that too leads to more connection.',
  # 'Honor Thy Self' => 'C-Game is a high-level game for skilled and willing players. There will be a minimum container.  Beyond that, we expect everyone to honor their boundaries and request whatever they need.',
  # 'Group Wisdom' => 'Groups can curate the Wild Card deck and co-hosts can add their own Main Courses because collective intelligence trumps what any one person can come up with. Besides, people tend to have more fun when involved!'
  'Practice Self-Leadership' => '“Honor Thy Self” used to be our one and only rule. Stretch your comfort zone. Know your boundaries. “Practice” means this is a growth edge for us all.',
  'Return To Connection' => 'Practicing self-leadership can be challenging. Remembering we all came here for deep connection, we agree to honor and support each other.',
  'Consider Group Health' => 'We ask, what does this group need? Then, we listen. Group intelligence arises. Ideally, each cares for all. This is the secret sauce of Connection Games!',
  'Open To Not Knowing' => 'Nurture curiosity in yourself and others. Circling welcomes everything. Wild Card puts that to the test. When you know you know… Is your heart open?'
