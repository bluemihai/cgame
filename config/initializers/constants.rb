VALUES = {
  'C for Connection' => 'The desire to connect is fundamental to C-Game. We prefer activities that connect us, rather than inform, heal or stimulate us. We co-host and co-create, because that too leads to more connection.',
  'Honor Thy Self' => 'C-Game is a high-level game for skilled and willing players. There will be a minimum container.  Beyond that, we expect everyone to honor their boundaries and request whatever they need.',
  'Group Wisdom' => 'Groups can curate the Wild Card deck and co-hosts can add their own Main Courses because collective intelligence trumps what any one person can come up with. Besides, people tend to have more fun when involved!'
